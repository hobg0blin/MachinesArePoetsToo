Digital technologies allow us to create a control structure with computational predictability and precision. What happens, however, when designers begin to incorporate the self-determined internal control structure of a biological system as part of a design strategy? This course offers a new approach to materiality, positing that all matter is dynamic but exists within a continuum of control ranging from passively temporal (wood, water) to electronically active (photovoltaics, thermochromics) to biologically alive (plants, tissue). This course presents alternative design strategies for creating computational interfacing with living matter and state change of natural materials. Students are introduced to the world of the bio lab from a designer\u2019s perspective, both conceptually and practically. We examine the state-of-the-art in artistic experimentation with biological systems such as the genetic manipulation projects of Eduardo Kac, or the carbon nanotubes grown into architectural structures of Ryan Wartena. We also examine more DIY approaches to living systems integration and interactivity with biological systems. Students use a hands-on approach in their design process, with biological sensing as input and indicators or material state change as an alternative method of information display, for example. This course is designed to further our computational relationship with the natural world pushing forward ideas in sustainability, interactivity, energy production and the emerging relationship between the designer\/artist and the bio lab, approaching biology as an open frontier for digital design.","datetime_start":"2010-06-01T23:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2010-06-01T23:00:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2010,"id":430,"title":"Web Tech 101","description":"How do HTML, Javascript, CSS, Ajax, PHP, Ruby, MySQL, Flash, etc. all fit together in your web applications?

There will be snacks if anyone needs enticement besides the topic and the guests.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Dr. Sekai Chideya holds a MPH. She's worked for the Centers for Disease Control's Epidemic Intelligence Service and the New York City Department of Health, focused on AIDS and TB studies domestically and internationally. I have worked for companies including ABC, CNN, Newsweek, NPR; I'm now getting ready to pilot a new public radio\/digial program. Together she and I will talk about the different ways in which we have brokered honest discussions and gotten the best data given issues\/tensions of race and \u00a0diasporic identity between investigators\/interviewers and subjects. Working as a journalist (me, Farai) and as a public health researcher (Sekai) has brought us into contact with people who may be suspicious of us; overly deferential; or any number of emotional\/social relations that have to be worked through in order for us to do good work.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to having a conversation that deals not only with the African Diaspora communities, but also with the entire construct of the observer and the observed, and of data gathering in the field...\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nF\r\n\r\n======= former description ============\r\n\r\nVarious parts of the African diaspora, from urban American communities to vast stretches of rural areas throughout the Continent, are being used as spaces to experiment. That includes everything from crowdsourcing content; building new revenue-sharing models for assets from oil to wind; and performing public health interventions.\r\n\r\nInnovation is good, but\/and if there's a disconnect between innovators and community, you can have big problems. I'd like to give a personal and professional perspective on things I've learned from interacting with African diaspora communities; and things I've learned from being part of two different ones.\r\n\r\nI'm black American by birth and upbringing; my father was also Zimbabwean and I have a lot of ties in Southern Africa and go back every 3 years. I have shot some documentary footage in Zimbabwe and almost had it confiscated by the secret police. When I go into a low-income black community in the U.S., or an African-American celebrity event, or a gay black male social space, I am an insider in some ways, an outsider in others.\r\n\r\nI suspect some of you are exploring not only technology but the power relationship between \"observer\" and \"observed.\" (We are all observed, but not all document their observations publicly.) I think people who want to work either with Africanas or Afro-diasporic communities in the US (from black American to Haitian-American and even Cuban- and Puerto Rican-American) might want to have a conversation.\r\n\r\nMore on me at faraichideya.com","datetime_start":"2010-06-04T21:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2010-06-05T23:00:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2010,"id":1472,"title":"Sensors and Interface Board--Easy!","description":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Workshop Web Page: <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.elasticmind.com\/itp\"><strong>www.elasticmind.com\/itp<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\r\nHagstrom Electronics makes a wonderful interface board for about $70. that makes it really easy to plug input from almost any sensor into an existing or custom computer\u00a0program.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hagstromelectronics.com\/products\/kead6.html\">http:\/\/www.hagstromelectronics.com\/products\/kead6.html<\/a> This session will demonstrate how to use sensors and this board to input sensor data into a program you create, or an existing one.\u00a0 The board takes up to 6 sensors simultaneously, and outputs dynamic sensor values as keystrokes into the USB port.\u00a0 So, for example, your simple photocell is wired into channel 1, and you program the board to return keystrokes \"a\",\"b\",\"c \"and \"d\" depending on how much light the photocell \"sees\".\u00a0 Once programmed, the board monitors the photocell and sends back the corresponding keystroke when the light level changes.\u00a0 If you program the board to return keystrokes like the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) then the board can feed these keystrokes into any program that is expecting the user to hit these keys for control of an object.\u00a0 So it's really easy to retrofit an existing program or game to accept user input from sensors.\u00a0 Typical sensors that work include photocells, switches, Sharp IR distance ranging sensor, force sensors, pots, etc.\u00a0 I will bring a variety of sensors and some boards and we will program them.\u00a0 The board will function autonomously on either PC or Mac, but must be programmed on a PC.\u00a0 Once programmed with a configuration of keystrokes matching sensor values, the board can hold that program permanently (until you want to reprogram it for another project).\u00a0 This is a really easy and fun way to integrate sensors into your project without coding a more complex microcontroller.","datetime_start":"2010-06-02T23:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2010-06-03T01:00:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2010,"id":1644,"title":"UX: Rapid Application Prototyping for Mobile and Web","description":"So you have a fantastic idea for a mobile or web application.

What should you do when you are motivated to change a behavior in the moment?\r\n\r\nBefore you begin \u2013 remember:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>1. Only record positive \u2013 motivating statements and pictures (Positive Self-Review)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2. Never highlight negative or degrading aspects of the self \u2013 record who you think you can be!<\/li>\r\n\t<li>3. You CAN record process as long as you end up in the place where you want to be.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nTake out your phone and audio or video record the following during those critical moments when you make the decision to change:\r\n\r\n1- WHAT DO YOU RECORD \u2013 (no more than 3-5 minutes)\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>a. What is your specific plan \u2013 be very specific \u2013 only include things in your plan that you will be able to achieve<\/li>\r\n\t<li>b. Why you want to change \u2013 this is the one area where you could discuss the consequences of not changing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>c. Show your self-performing behavior or being motivated (audio).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>d. What would you say to yourself if you were considering not changing<\/li>\r\n\t<li>e. What are the barriers and how will you deal with them when you are confronted by them (implementation intentions)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>f. Who you want to be and that if you are not feeling it today does not mean it is not real.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>g. Who is your motivator?<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n2- UPLOAD: Keep on phone or upload to closed youtube site and link via text message or email\r\n\r\n3- PLAYBACK \u2013 WHEN IS PLAYBACK\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>a. Schedule in calendar or SMS\/email to alert every two days for a week<\/li>\r\n\t<li>b. Schedule in calendar or SMS\/email to alert 2 days in next week<\/li>\r\n\t<li>c. Then once a week for 90 days.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>d. Send to friend and ask them to put in their calendar<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n4- Re-record your message as necessary (at least every 90 days) with new information\r\n\r\n<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.9px Times} -->Maintaining motivation using audio review\r\n\r\n<strong>Articles by Fred\r\n<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.behavioral.net\/ME2\/dirmod.asp?sid=45D4F1BC1C2F41E6A754ED831BD98648&amp;nm=&amp;type=Blog&amp;mod=View+Topic&amp;mid=66A53481AC7B4A13B45D7CDA7A9B920B&amp;tier=7&amp;id=F4384B9279974DB0A49A907B153A2A9B\" target=\"_blank\">Technology supports self modeling\r\n<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/muench_motivation_process.pdf\">Maintaining motivation using audio review<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","datetime_start":"2011-06-17T17:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2011-06-17T18:00:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":736,"title":"Open Hardware Round Table","description":"[caption id=\"attachment_1003\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"688\" caption=\"Makerbot, Arduino, Little Bits\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/OSHWRoundTable.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1003\" src=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/OSHWRoundTable.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"688\" height=\"196\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRound table with Alicia Gibb (Bug Labs, NYC Resistor &amp; Open Hardware Summit), Ayah Bdeir (Little Bits &amp; Open Hardware Summit), Bre Pettis (Makerbot), Tom Igoe (Arduino &amp; ITP), Catarina Mota (openMaterials).\r\n\r\nFree and open source software has been around for several decades during which it evolved from an informal practice of academic and corporate researchers into a multi-billion dollar industry.

The military has been using these robots for years, but it has been only recently that the technology to create flying robots has become available to hobbyists.  There are several open source communities developing autonomous flying platforms.   These robots have practical uses such as aerial photography, wildlife tracking, surveillance, cartography and just pure fun to fly.\r\n\r\nWe'll show you how to get started in building a flying robot. We will go over different open source platforms. Find the best approach for building a drone for specific applications.

It's more an un-tournament, being organized as an ad hoc follow-on to my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/?p=942\" target=\"_blank\">session on games<\/a> this past Sunday. EVERYONE'S WELCOME and no need to have come to that session to enjoy the tournament.)\r\n\r\nPlease sign up\u00a0below. It will be very helpful for planning to know how many people are coming.\r\n\r\nThere will be around 10 games of all sorts, some physical, some strategic, some fast-paced, some artistic, some social, some solitary. All games will all be accesible and easy-to-learn on the spot. You can also come a bit early to practice if you want (and only if you want). NO EXPERIENCE WITH ANY OF THE GAMES NEEDED.\r\n\r\nThe better you do in each game, the more tournament point you'll earn. We'll keep a running tally on a wall of how everyone's doing and in the end give our various prizes (e.g. best at strategy games, best at physical games, etc.) and of course a Grand Prize for being the best overall.\r\n\r\nTo make it more competitive, we'll try some handicapping based on player's general level of experience (starting from \"none\") with the games, and we'll also have a tournament scoring formula that, for instance, ignores the 2 or 3 worst scores on individual games you got.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tournament, we'll spend some time talking about the experience, referencing the different game platforms, game mechanics, social mechanics, and types of fun discussed at last Sunday's session. Again, no worries if you didn't come to the session; it will all still make sense and be educational.\r\n\r\nFinally, hopefully we can get someone to take some photos and videos of highlights during the afternoon, and perhaps someone can DJ some music. And we'll see about beer and snacks.\r\n\r\nHere's the tentative game-plan, subject to revision.\r\n\r\nAs an ice-breaker, we'll start with a group party game called Mafia:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mafia_(party_game)\" target=\"_blank\">Mafia<\/a> - the classic party game of social persuasion and acting in which everyone plays together. You are either a mafia member or a townsperson. Each \"night\" someone gets secretly killed by the mafia. The townpeople then debate who to kill in return for being a suspected mafia member. The longer you live, the more tournament points you get. If you've never played, you are in for a psychological treat.\r\n\r\nThen we'll have a series of small group games:\r\n\r\n2. Scrabble - 4 players at a time. The normal word-tile game, except with a chess-style timer to keep things moving along. Play multiple times with different opponents as time allows. The more Scrabble points you get, the more tournament points you get.\r\n\r\n3.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stratego\" target=\"_blank\">Stratego<\/a> (the Barrage of \"speed\" version) - a face-paced version of Stratego, a classic 1-on-1 board game simulating two armies fighting each other. Easy to learn, hard to master.\r\n\r\n4.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/harbor-master\/id313014213?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Harbor Master<\/a> - a top-selling \"casual game\" for iPad. You are the harbor master and have to make sure the ships unload their cargo without crashing. It's a at times calm, at times frantic game of \"attention management\". Use the wonderfully intuitive touch interface to draw routes for ships, shoot the attacking pirates, and kill the giant squid. If time allows, we'll play single player and two people cooperating at a time. Also we'll project the image on a large screen for spectator enjoyment.\r\n\r\n5.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=bomberman&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=diABTtu7KYn2gAf8w4T-DQ&amp;ved=0CF8QsAQ&amp;biw=963&amp;bih=810\" target=\"_blank\">Bomberman<\/a> - a classic dead simple but completely engrossing multiplayer game where everyone is trying to blow up everyone else. 4 players at a time. Last person standing wins. Great fun, and great to watch also.\r\n\r\nWe'll also have a few 1 player games:\r\n\r\n6. Clock - a mesmerizing, abstractly beautiful game of concentration and hand-eye coordination by game designer Luke O'Conner. Featured at NYU Game Center's recent No Quarter exhibition of indie games, for which it was commissioned. Takes a minute to play but totally addictive and you'll want to keep playing to get it right.\r\n\r\n7.<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/?p=1528\" target=\"_blank\"> Whac-a-Wall<\/a> - my ITP Camp 1-in-1 project! Like Whac-a-Mole but on a wall, using Kinect for motion detection. See how many critters you can whack in a minute. Involves jumping and waving your arms around and getting maniacally laughed at when you miss (or when my calibration is off...)\r\n\r\n8. Passage + reflections on Passage. Passage is a 5-minute \"art game\" by noted indie game designer Jason Rohrer (see\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esquire.com\/features\/best-and-brightest-2008\/future-of-video-game-design-1208-2\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a> Esquire magazine profile). Be warned, this surprising little game might make you cry. The contest is this tournament isn't to cry the most, but to express your thoughts and feelings in the most compelling way after you play. We'll put the game in a separate room and give you some time to write or draw some post-play thoughts. Then everyone will vote on the thoughts and you get tournament points based on these votes.\r\n\r\nFor a note of randomness, we'll have:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n9.<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pass_the_Pigs\" target=\"_blank\"> Pass the Pigs<\/a>. A game of complete chance that you can't stop playing once you get in the mood. Good dumb fun -- or deep philosophical truth?\r\n\r\nAnd finally, to end the festivities, we'll play:\r\n\r\n10. Ping Pong -- Around the World! We might be able to get a full-sized ping pong table onto the floor so we can play. One idea is to end the tournament with the group game variant of Ping Pong called \"Around the World\". Everyone runs around and around the table hitting the ball back and forth. You get eliminated from the rotation if you miss. Last person to survive wins. Watch\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gQdqBMC8Q5Q&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">this <\/a>for an idea of how it works.\r\n\r\nThe exact plan will evolve over the coming week. Please share suggestions, ideas, and requests.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tournament, we'll hand out prizes and see what we've learned after an afternoon that will hopefully have been a lot of fun together.\r\n\r\nAgain, please sign up below so I know how many people to plan for, or email me. Also if you want help with video\/photos, DJ'ing, keeping score, or whatever, that'd be much appreciated!\r\n","datetime_start":"2011-06-26T19:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2011-06-26T22:00:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":2524,"title":"Proclipsing: Processing + Eclipse","description":"The Processing Development Environment is\u00a0 a great way to get started programming, but there are other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that have features that make coding and debugging much easier.\u00a0 One such IDE is Eclipse, the popular free and open source Java standard.\u00a0 Though powerful, Eclipse can take some getting used to, as the number of tools, functions, and GUI elements can be confusing.\u00a0 Proclipsing is a plugin for Eclipse that simplifies the basics of creating a Processing Project in Eclipse and exporting them.\u00a0 This session will discuss how to install Eclipse, add Proclipsing to it, and start taking advantage of the features of Eclipse to write code better and faster.","datetime_start":"2011-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2011-06-30T00:30:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":2524,"title":"Proclipsing: Processing + Eclipse","description":"The Processing Development Environment is\u00a0 a great way to get started programming, but there are other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that have features that make coding and debugging much easier.\u00a0 One such IDE is Eclipse, the popular free and open source Java standard.\u00a0 Though powerful, Eclipse can take some getting used to, as the number of tools, functions, and GUI elements can be confusing.\u00a0 Proclipsing is a plugin for Eclipse that simplifies the basics of creating a Processing Project in Eclipse and exporting them.\u00a0 This session will discuss how to install Eclipse, add Proclipsing to it, and start taking advantage of the features of Eclipse to write code better and faster.","datetime_start":"2011-06-25T16:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2011-06-25T18:30:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":2540,"title":"Get Your Hands Dirty!

For the host\/cook, it is a chance to not only create a social hub but to express oneself through the food that is prepared and served to guests. Sous Vide and Acvita (Meat Glue) are force multipliers that can dramatically amplify the size, scope, and level of creativity behind the dinner parties that you throw. This session will introduce both techniques and explain how you can use them to throw kick ass dinners for your friends.\r\n\r\nSous vide cooking means cooking under vacuum, typically with the help of an immersion circulator, which is a high precision water temperature regulator. Learn the basics of how to use a vacuum sealer and an immersion circulator to create an incredibly wide range of foods. I will introduce the basic methods to cook with sous vide, display a few examples of sous vide recipes, discuss safety, and how you can create\/hack your own sous vide setup at home.\r\n\r\nAlso up for discussion is an introduction to Activa, affectionately known in culinary circles as \"meat glue.\" Activa is an enzyme that binds proteins together and can be used to make novel gastronomic delights. It also plays a synergistic role with sous vide techniques and its usage will be integrated into the sous vide tutorial.\r\n\r\nBio: Mike Lee is the founder and chef of Studiofeast, an invitation only dining collective based in NYC.

The chatter of our minds is going a mile a minute to no avail. When we really need our creative muse to show up, she somehow has the uncanny ability to hide like a needle in a haystack and then show up at 3:00am as we bolt upright out of bed, making our way in the dark to scribble down the ideas she's handed to us. For too long we've accepted that's just the way creativity and imagination work - unpredictably.\r\n\r\nYoga - physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation - helps us tap into our imaginations at will and with ease, exactly when we need them. A regular yoga practice keeps our minds sharp, helps us make connections between seemingly disparate bits of information that may otherwise go unnoticed, and causes us to imagine solutions to complex challenges. By learning to quiet the mind, we give our greatest ideas the chance to rise to the top. Yoga gives us a way forward.\r\n\r\nThis session will provide a sample class geared toward enhancing creativity. It will include a few basic standing postures that can be done in your everyday clothes. The breathing and meditation techniques will all be practiced seated. It is helpful for everyone who needs to tap into their own creativity on a regular basis - from performers to programmers, in all mediums.

She told us that Stefan will send us a link to more \"Ikea\" like instructions for the various sub-systems and thought that we can divide our team into groups to work on the sub-systems once we have the materials in. She and Stefan are agreeable to using a Google+ hangout instead of skype for communicating.

We have also been working with the camp staff to see how best to purchase and source parts for a large group (i.e., purchasing it all at once and collecting funds from interested parties).

After this workshop you\u2019ll have the chops to dig into the API, navigate our site\u2019s 215 code examples and 30 in-depth tutorials, ask questions on the C4 \/ StackOverflow forum and grab code from the various GitHub accounts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.c4ios.com\/\">http:\/\/www.c4ios.com<\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Things you need:\r\n<\/strong>If you want to be building iOS apps you should bring a Mac with the latest version of Xcode installed.

This board has the heart of an Arduino Leonardo attached to a WiFi-equipped Linux processor.\r\n\r\nThe Y\u00fan\u00a0(which means cloud in Chinese) was developed this new board in conjunction with Hong Kong electronics manufacturer Dog Hunter, and is designed to give you the simplicity of Arduino, combined with the power of \u00a0WiFi and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/openwrt.org\/\">OpenWRT<\/a>\u00a0Linux distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Y\u00fan isn't due for release until later in June, but in this session, I'll give you a sneak peek at the\u00a0Y\u00fan and show you what it's capable of.\r\n\r\nMost Arduino users are familiar with how to connect an Arduino to another computer via the Serial port, and the Y\u00fan builds on that mental model, using a new library called Bridge.

There\u2019s more tricks and skills to the story, but without this one the rest of them never get read.\r\n<blockquote>\u201cHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d<\/blockquote>\r\nIn this class we\u2019ll sit there, for hours, and talk about how to build a lede. You'll write, and read, and write again. It'll all take too long. It won\u2019t be anywhere near enough time. You can\u2019t do it until you know what you think; that can take years. But once you have the lede down, the stories you tell will be more true, even the fake one.\r\n<blockquote>\u201cHis followers called him Mahasamatman and said he was a god. He preferred to drop the Maha- and the -atman, however, and called himself Sam. He never claimed to be a god. But then, he never claimed not to be a god.\u201d<\/blockquote>\r\nIt\u2019s not just about fiction, it\u2019s not even just about writing, it\u2019s about any idea that takes the form of a narrative, that contains an arc.\r\n<blockquote>\u201cDepression is the flaw in love.\u201d<\/blockquote>\r\nIt\u2019s where writing comes together, if it manages to come together at all. It\u2019s the heart of the matter, the tl;dr. It\u2019s the grave where, when we speak badly, we bury our meanings in misplaced efforts to stay safe. The lede is a place where we boil down and clarify, and once we have it nailed, it protects the rest of the story.\r\n<blockquote>\u201cFrank Sinatra, holding a glass of bourbon in one hand and a cigarette in the other, stood in a dark corner of the bar between two attractive but fading blondes who sat waiting for him to say something.\u201d<\/blockquote>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","datetime_start":"2013-06-08T23:30:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2013-06-09T02:30:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2013,"id":3072,"title":"Intro to the Soft Lab","description":"This workshop will introduce you to the basics of using ITP's soft lab resources -- specifically the sewing machines, the embroidery machine, and the vinyl cutter. \u00a0This will mostly be a demo session, so no materials are required!","datetime_start":"2013-06-08T02:30:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2013-06-08T03:30:00.000Z","tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2013,"id":3073,"title":"AT&amp;T AdWorks Lab Tour","description":"I'll give a quick and informal tour of the AdWorks Media Lab.\u00a0 We'll look at how we used Cinder to create some very cool (at least we think so!) data visualizations and explain how we developed the narrative for the entire space.\u00a0 You can see the pool table that will soon be transformed into a completely, interactive experience!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, you'll also get a sneak peek at the redesign that we're currently doing that will launch in September.\r\n\r\nI do need to give names to security, so if you're thinking bout coming, please let me know so I can put you on the building security list.\u00a0\u00a0It'll be informal and casual!\u00a0 Don't hesitate to holler if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nAnd if you can't come on Friday and still want to see the space, just let me know.

While Perich's work aims to integrate low-level computation with traditional artistic media, this workshop intends to teach a basic understanding of Assembly, a low-level programming language that drives most hardware at its foundation. The workshop is intended for those with a basic understanding of computer programming, though it is not necessary. Participants will learn how to program an Amtel microprocessor, a low-cost, highly versatile microchip similar to those used in Arduino boards and in Perich's own 1-Bit Symphony.\r\n\r\n<strong>Requirements:<\/strong>Mac laptop,\r\n<div><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Software <\/span><\/b><\/div>\r\n<div><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mac: <em>please download the following software prior to the workshop<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><i>If Mac OS 10.8 gives you a warning about installing software from an unknown developer, right-click the installer and select \"Open\" from the context menu to allow you to override the message.<\/i><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><b>AVR Cross Pack<\/b>: (Programming tools)<\/div>\r\n<div>Info:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/obdev.at\/products\/crosspack\/download.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/obdev.at\/<wbr \/>products\/crosspack\/download.<wbr \/>html<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div>Direct Download:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/obdev.at\/downloads\/crosspack\/CrossPack-AVR-20130212.dmg\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/obdev.at\/<wbr \/>downloads\/crosspack\/CrossPack-<wbr \/>AVR-20130212.dmg<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><b>FTDI Chip Driver<\/b>: (Driver for hardware programmer)<\/div>\r\n<div>Info:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/ftdichip.com\/Drivers\/VCP.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/ftdichip.com\/<wbr \/>Drivers\/VCP.htm<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div>Direct Download:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/ftdichip.com\/Drivers\/VCP\/MacOSX\/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_18.dmg\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/ftdichip.com\/<wbr \/>Drivers\/VCP\/MacOSX\/<wbr \/>FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_18.<wbr \/>dmg<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><b>Tavrasm<\/b>: (Mac Assembler)<\/div>\r\n<div>Direct Download:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tristanperich.com\/files\/tavrasm\/tavrasm.zip\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/<wbr \/>tristanperich.com\/files\/<wbr \/>tavrasm\/tavrasm.zip<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><b>STK Friend<\/b>: (User-friendly programming tool)<\/div>\r\n<div>Dirct Download:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tristanperich.com\/files\/stkfriend\/stkfriend2014b.zip\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/<wbr \/>tristanperich.com\/files\/<wbr \/>stkfriend\/stkfriend2014b.zip<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><b>And a good text editor!<\/b><\/div>\r\nThis session is <strong>limited to 10 participants<\/strong>.

Or, in other words, a simple way to connect interactive things to one another. Every element you hook up to the system is identified as either a subscriber (reading data in) or a publisher (pushing data out). Data is in one of three standardized formats: a boolean (true\/false), a number range (0-1023) or a string (text). Once these elements are set up, you can use a web based visual switchboard to connect or disconnect publishers and subscribers to each other.\u00a0Learn more at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/docs.spacebrew.cc\/\">spacebrew.cc<\/a>\r\n\r\nSpacebrew is an open source project that was originally developed at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockwellgroup.com\/lab\">LAB at Rockwell Group<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thank You<\/strong>\r\nThanks to everyone who joined the workshop this week.

He was hooked, spending hours writing video games, music programs, and simple forms of artificial intelligence. The obsession stuck with him, even as he went to the University of Toronto to study poetry and political science. When he became a magazine writer in the 1990s, the Internet erupted into the mainstream, and he began reporting on how digital tools\u00e2\u20ac\u201deverything from email to digital photography to instant messaging\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas changing society.\r\n\r\nClive started out pessimistic about the impact of the Internet on life. He worried, like many social critics before him, that society and civility would fall off a cliff. But over the next twenty years he realized that when everyday people were given remarkable powers of self-expression on a global scale, amazing things happened more often than not: Wikipedia, YouTube \u00e2\u20ac\u0153response\u00e2\u20ac\u009d conversations, collaborative art, crazy new forms of writing like TV recaps, collaborative problem-solving, and the ESP-like awareness that comes from the status-update universe.\r\n\r\nToday, Thompson is one of the most prominent technology writers, respected for doing deeply-reported, long-form magazine stories that get beyond headlines and harness the insights of science, literature, history and philosophy. He specializes in writing not merely on the inventors of technologies, but about how everyday people use them\u00e2\u20ac\u201doften quite unpredictably. In addition to the New York Times Magazine and Wired, he writes for Mother Jones and Smithsonian. He is one of the longest-running bloggers, having launched his science-and-tech blog Collision Detection since 2002.

I have done a number of hardware, software, and sculptural projects that use some of these elements. \r\n\r\n**Class Outline** \r\n---\r\nFirst Half\r\n---\r\n*Processes:*\r\n\r\n * Centered Problem Solving\r\n\r\n * Project Diagrams\r\n\r\n * Technical Specification  \r\n\r\n * Flow Diagram\r\n\r\n * Material Resourcing\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nBreak: 10min \r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\nSecond Half\r\n---\r\n*Software:*\r\n\r\n   * Sketch - 2D interfaces\r\n\r\n   * SketchUp - 3D printing \r\n\r\n   * Illustrator - Laser Cutting\r\n\r\n*Resources:*\r\n\r\n* 3D Warehouse\r\n\r\n* Data Resources: Data.gov and how to unearth the data you want.\r\n\r\n---\r\nClass Details\r\n---\r\n**Centered Problem Solving** is the method of putting yourself in another person's shoes so you understand what causes them pain and what makes them happy. This process will look at how you solve problems for people you've never met. The best way to do this is by talking to people, doing second hand research, and being open to surprises. You will be wrong sometimes, do be prepared to throwing your ideas away and be wrong early. \r\n\r\nP.S. Don't be anthropocentric, these principle can be used to solve problems for animals, plants, the climate or whatever. It is a centered approach to thinking.\r\n\r\n**Project Diagrams** look at encapsulated constituent components and connects them in a logical way. For instance, a new pair of shoes need shoe laces, socks, and the shoe bodies. How do we fit them together to make something awesome? This illustrates how the parts make a whole.\r\n\r\n**Tech Specs** analyzes what aspects of a component are required to work for the project. The shoe laces must be 12in for dress shoes, but 26in for lace up boots. What color, what material, what thickness etc? The wrong size screw can hold a project up for hours, a missing sensor for days, an unknown variable for weeks. Plan ahead! \r\n\r\n**Flow Diagram** think about how your project lives in the real world. Are your shoes on display? Are they in a production line for 10,000 units? Are they going to space? This process looks at how the project fits into the real world.\r\n\r\n**Resource Acquisition** is the art of collecting the appropriate elements to execute you vision. Where do I get the leather for the shell of the shoes? Where do I find the 3D printer with the right material to print the sole? Where do I find aluminum sheeting for the aglets on my shoe laces? This part I affectionately call enphysication - making your dream a reality. In software, this is finding the frameworks, libraries, and people you need to make the project.\r\n\r\nThis will be covered in a way generic enough to apply to Software, Hardware, and Sculpture, or whatever you can imagine. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Half of the class will look at the best programs and resources I have found to execute my designs and communicate my vision. These programs help fill in the gaps that sketching and concepting miss. The more you translate your physical designs to digital assets the easier it is to document, reuse, and communicate your ideas.\r\n\r\nPhysical drawing are wonderful, but you can only ever have one copy, and you can't undo changes. Whiteboarding is cool, but only people drawing with you at the time will understand the images.\r\n\r\nThis is how we make order from imagination. I look forward to sharing my process with you. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJames W.

With a little bit of effort, these machine listening techniques can be applied so that the content of the signal directly controls parameters of a transformation - akin to a bunch of people listening to a guitarist and turning the knobs on their pedals, so that the effects closely follow aspects of the playing. We'll also see how various features can be used to control virtually anything outside of the source signal, such as auto-generation of visuals or motion. I'll also briefly touch upon the inverse - how to generate audio from features extracted from other sources.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover things like Chroma for Automatic Key and Chord Recognition, recognizing\/classifying signals by spectral content, beat tracking, and basic strategies for mapping features onto controls.

I am looking forward to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class.\r\n\r\nFour hours is a drop in the bucket when it comes to this stuff. I want to hit the ground running, and move fast. So here are a few ways that we can grease the wheels.\r\n\r\n1) Download and install Max. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think, just do it. Make a Cycling74 account so you can register the demo. This will, no joke, save us fifteen minutes at the start of the session. If you have already popped the Max demo and it has expired, do yourself a favor and drop $13 ($10 if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got an academic ID) on a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license.  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want the 64bit version of Max 7, appropriate for your platform. Please note that those of you using Chromebooks or some other kind of non-OS X \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnix flavor will *not* be able to play along. Sorry!\r\n\r\n2) Play with it. Really! Open some tutorials, get a sense of Max\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workflow: top down, left to right. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to work on this a little, but I guarantee it will take a little bit of time to click. Be confused; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first step towards understanding.\r\n\r\n3) Bring a sensor. Those of you with Arduino projects will want to bring them. Those of you with weird sensors in hand that have some kind of driver that works with your machine will benefit greatly from this session. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mac-compatible, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll even work it into the session if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weird enough.\r\n\r\n4) Bring patches you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to spend the last hour of the session as a Max clinic, working with the patches that campers bring in. \r\n\r\n5) Bring questions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to run out of pre-prepared material around the end of hour two; this is deliberate. I want this to be as useful as possible, and merely going down my own rabbit hole will do little of value for campers who are stuck in holes of their design. \r\n\r\nIn general, be prepared to speak up and complain if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand something. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really downloaded and launched and registered it, after that there are very few questions that will annoy me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taught this stuff for a long time and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to answer any and all questions once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve passed the initial hurdle. \r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very excited for this session and humbled to have thirty RSVPs.

Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States of America is a xenophobe, racist, misogynist, bully and con artist. He has been compared to demagogues and elected strongmen. Trump has also shown himself to be a blatant liar who enjoys creating and promoting conspiracy theories. He has support from white supremacist groups. Trump has proven himself to be a master manipulator of the media and he so far has generated over $2 billion worth of free media, exponentially more than any other candidate. http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1U4o1Ef Television networks and other media channels have unfairly provided Trump with unequal amounts of airtime and news coverage. Trump is an active user of social channels like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\r\n\r\nTrump is a divider, not a uniter of people. His discourse and outrageous promises have reduced our civility. Most GOP politicians are shocked that Trump is their nominee. Many Republicans even though they said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never support Trump have quickly fallen in line. Other Republican party members are actively looking for alternatives.\r\n\r\nGOAL\r\n\r\nI believe Trump needs to be exposed in everyway possible, his support and ratings diminished.  To achieve this, average citizens must stand up and have their voices heard. This is also an urgent need as time is working against us. During the ITP 2016 camp I recommend that we allocate time toward this civil action using the unique expertise and talents of interested camp members and others. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m recommending we come together, network, digest media, discuss and use our expertise in branding, writing, programming, media and content creation, data and analytics, social media, making stuff, etc. to create ways to attack, counter and take down the Trump ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe session will be run like a basecamp where we can discuss critical concepts and strategies; find partners to work with and review work to date. I hope we can meet at least one time per week. The goal is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153move the needle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and achieve demonstrable results, to have our voices amplified and heard.

In his lifelong study of the human unconscious, Jung found that below an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal unconscious was a deeper strata he termed the \\\\\\'collective unconscious\\\\\\'. This is the layer of the psyche that is common to all people.

You can think of archetypes as images, motifs, instructs and centres of energy and attraction all rolled up into one. When we watch movies, hear stories, we are watching and hearing archetypes. The original Star Wars trilogy, for example, got its cult-like status due to its successful use of archetypal motifs.

This is how things like touch lamps work, and the basic sensing in fun kits like the Makey Makey: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU)\r\n\r\nHowever, most folks tend to start their capacitive touch sensing projects using (what I consider) outdated methods. Old-fashioned captouch tends to be noisy, needing constant recalibration, and really only works well when the electronics are grounded. It also tends to give best readings on just a binary \"Touched or not\" kind of basis. Most importantly old style cap-touch tends to use a minimum of 2 wires and a big resistor to make your interaction work.\r\n\r\nUsing ADC captouch, instead frees us from so many problems, and gives us the smallest amount of materials necessary to make cool interesting sensors! Places like Hackteria started looking to this method as an improvement over the Makey Makey ([http:\/\/www.hackteria.org\/projects\/cocomake7\/](http:\/\/www.hackteria.org\/projects\/cocomake7\/)), and we can talk about the basic theory while we make them!\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL WE DO\r\n\r\nFirst we will start off building and programming our devices. Then we will move outdoors and test out and explore the touch-sensitive properties of many items in nature and public areas nearby.

Actually I have no idea who or how many people go there, but this is the third year I've organized this and it is consistently inspiring and enjoyable.'\r\n\r\n**DIRECTIONS**\r\n\r\nThank you for signing up to participate in the Coloring with Basquiat field trip. This field trip is weather dependent. Bring your crayons.\r\n\r\n(1) Check your e-mail before heading out to make sure I haven't announced any changes.\r\n\r\n(2) The meeting point is Basquiat's grave in the historic Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn. I will arrive there on Saturday around 1PM and will stay until around 2:30PM. You are welcome to arrive any time, but I encourage you to arrive earlier than later.\r\n\r\n(3) There are several entrances to Green-Wood and depending on which entrance you take the route to get to the grave is different. I recommend taking the F or G to Church Avenue Station. From there it is a short walk to the Eastern Entrance off Ft. Hamilton. The following directions are from that entrance.\r\n\r\nEnter the grounds on Ft. Hamilton Parkway near McDonald Ave. Make a left when you enter the cemetery (the road is called Border Avenue) and take it to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grape Avenue.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  When you reach the intersection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fir Avenue,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d start cutting through diagonally until you reach a row of small headstones.  \r\n\r\nThe full map is available here (ask for one at the entrance):\r\n\r\n**[Map of Green-Wood](http:\/\/www.green-wood.com\/html\/wp-content\/uploads\/apdf\/green_wood_map.pdf)**\r\n\r\nIf you get lost you can call me here: +1 (206) 683-4962\r\n\r\n(4) I recommend watching at least one of the following two films in advance. \r\n\r\nThe Radiant Child - A comprehensive documentary on Basquiat's life.

The goal of the session is to explore how study and use of AI may influence human thought processes.\r\n\r\nThis session is for people into AI, neurology, psychology, brain science, and psychedelics. It helps to have an appreciation for the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary, and Aldous Huxley.\r\n\r\n**Talk - 30 Minutes** - The session will start with a short talk on the current state of AI and its implications for the future. I will then share stories from artists & scientists working with AI on the changes they have observed in their thinking that seem related to their study. Finally I will wrap up the stories with some wild speculation to set the stage for open discussion.\r\n\r\n**Discussion - 60 Minutes** - After the talk we will open the floor for participants to share their AI related stories. We will discuss and explore the rationality and implication of the stories and see what conclusions if any we can collectively reach.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nA little over a year ago I began to come up to speed with the latest in AI. Having taken workshops at SFPC and ITP Camp on the subject I began studying the technology and experimenting with all sorts of applications. My ITP Camp project last year was a series of interactive paintings made using AI.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of intense study I began noticing changes in certain aspects of my own thinking. It seemed as if what I had learned from studying AI was influencing how my own mind functioned.\r\n\r\nA year later, AI has become a central topic of global discussion as it transforms the landscapes of countless businesses. \r\n\r\nA year later, I continue to observe significant changes in my thinking as I study the technology, and I'm increasingly hearing similar stories from other people.\r\n\r\nIn general I prefer to spend a significant amount of time synthesizing ideas around a subject before giving a talk on it. However this is an area moving so quickly that it feels necessary to begin discussion sooner than later.","datetime_start":"2017-06-25T18:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2017-06-25T19:30:00.000Z","tag_list":["ai","machine-learning"],"location_name":"Room 50"},{"year":2017,"id":97,"title":"Revealing Migraine through Art & Science","description":"**In this session we will explore the relationship between Art & Science through the lens of Migraine.** The session is extremely relevant for anyone who suffers from Migraine, but the lessons are applicable to any discipline.\r\n\r\nMigraine is degenerative neurological condition experienced by 18% of women and 6% of men on average. While commonly discussed as a headache, Migraine is actually a very complex condition that can disrupt the brain and body in countless ways.\r\n\r\nThe past 10 years has been amazing for research on Migraine. Scientists have a comprehensive understanding of the condition and new treatments are actively in development that could significantly improve the situation for many sufferers.\r\n\r\nThat said what the scientists have found could have been discovered sooner had they considered the work of artists suffering from the condition. Artworks depicting the condition going back over a hundred years contained much of what was needed to reach the answers we have today. Yet artwork was dismissed as an input to the scientific process due to its subjective nature. \r\n\r\nMigraine is a perfect example of where the failure of Art & Science to collaborate for cultural reasons resulted directly in human suffering. My hope is that in the future it can also be an example of where Art & Science work together to quickly aid the hundreds of millions of people suffering world wide from this condition.\r\n\r\n60 minute talk followed by 30 minutes of discussion.","datetime_start":"2017-06-17T21:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2017-06-17T22:30:00.000Z","tag_list":["health"],"location_name":"Room 15"},{"year":2017,"id":98,"title":"Math in Code 4 Noobs","description":"Learn how to use basic trigonometry to make your p5 sketch awesome!

How do scientific sensor companies get away with charging 10x to 50x the cost of electronic parts?   Can we still depend on NOAA and the NSF to lead the way on climate change data collection?  We will explore these questions through discussion and by looking at case studies of low cost open source hardware alternatives to commercial sensors.  Topics include DIY CO2 monitoring, ocean temperature and current tracking, radar based river flow gages, and measuring drinking water turbidity.  We will look at sensor applications and calibration issues for science, citizen science and data based environmental design. Strategies for transitioning hardware from a single prototype to a small production run will be shared.  We will also discuss the different business and production models for bringing hardware to a larger community via peer reviewed journal publication, open source licensing and for profit ventures.   The focus here is on environmental sensors, but most of the issues discussed apply to hardware development in general.   The workshop will include the presentation of case studies through documentation and hands on experimentation with circuits.

The CAP is 20 people, because of the space required to effectively learn and have enough room to practice drills. \r\n\r\nSystema (\u00d0\u00a1\u00d0\u00b8\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u201a\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00b0, literally meaning The System) is a Russian martial art. Training includes, but is not limited to: hand-to-hand combat, grappling, knife fighting, and firearms training. (NOTE: we will be focused on the basics, and this will NOT include grappling, knife fighting or firearms, though it is really fun! ;)\r\nThis is an INTRO class to the basics of Systema to give you skills to be more safe in the world. \r\n\r\nTypical training involves drills and sparring without set kata (that most traditional martial arts have). In Systema, the goal is to free the body of tension, fill it with breath and enhance endurance, flexibility, and effortless movement. It is a very practical martial art. \r\n\r\nKey to the philosophy of Systema, the  \"spirit\" or psychological state aims to be calm, free of anger, irritation, fear, self-pity, delusion, ego and pride.\r\n\r\nSystema has four pillars - Breathing, Relaxation, Body Position, and Movement, as well as utilizing an attacker's momentum against him and controlling the six body levers (elbows, neck, knees, waist, ankles, and shoulders) through pressure point application, striking, and weapon applications (this last part will NOT be demonstrated in this class). \r\n\r\nAs a discipline, it is becoming more and more popular among police and security forces and it is taught by several practitioners inside and outside Russia. There are multiple schools of Systema - Systema Kadochnikova, Systema Ryabko, Systema Vasiliev. I have been lucky to train with these Masters and in other schools, and would love to share the best of what I've learned! \r\n\r\nWe will go over the basics, pair up, and do group demonstrations while having a lot of fun without actually hurting anyone. (But please take this class at your own risk!) Hopefully, you will leave with a basic knowledge of Systema and some skills to use when needed.

","description":"Web3.0 development nears a tipping point, as civil society finally gets the bill for all our \"free\" social media accounts, email, search and other basic web platforms. We are giving away the single most valuable asset remaining on Earth, our personal data, and we recieve little to none of the transformative AI insights and business process recommendations that are generated by carefully analyzing each user's every word, using sentiment analysis and other semantic web tools. In giving away free and total access to our online behaviors and every word we type, we have helped power a juggernaut AI training framework for Google, Fb, Amazon, etc. who continuously fail to protect this precious resource, as evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica\/FB scandal, and associated social engineering, meant to disrupt the very fabric of our political process. \r\nHad enough? \r\nWant to understand alternative options and learn how to build the future? The future web will be decentralized, and likely see the decoupling of data from the application layer. Self-sovereign identity is an essential aspect of designing a better data model. So how can we rebuild \"The Web of Trust\" using Self-Soverign Identity? \r\n\r\nAs a very basic starting point, identity is the human capacity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rooted in language \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to know \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (and hence \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122)\r\nIdentity is hard to pin down...\r\nA Concept\r\n\r\nA physical card\r\n\r\nA range of alternatives\r\n\r\nAlways Evolving\r\n\r\nSelf-Sovereign Identity\r\n\r\nEvery individual human being is the original source of their own identity\r\n\r\nIdentity is not an administrative mechanism for others to control\r\n\r\nNo one may charge rent or be able revoke another's identity\r\n\r\nEach individual is the root of their own identity, and central to its\r\nadministration\r\n\r\nThe role of names, citizenship, licenses & other credentials should be distinct as \"verified claims\" offered by their issuers, not as identifiers\r\nof a human being\r\n\r\nWe need Self-Soverign Identity\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO FORM ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS BETWEEN:\r\n\r\nLOCAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nLEADING RESEARCH INSTITUTES\r\n\r\nDOMAIN EXPERTS, SCIENTISTS, POLICY MAKERS\r\n\r\nARTISTS AND INFLUENCERS\r\n\r\nECO\u00c2\u00adFEEDBACK SYSTEMS AND SENSE INTERFACES\r\n\r\n& COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE, AI & GOVERNANCE Frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis workshop and talk will provide an opportunity to dive right in and create your self-sovereign identity using a number of free and open source software (Keybase.io, UPort, Civic, Blockstack) \r\n\r\nWe will create a working Self Sovereign Identity dApp (decentralized application) that allows users to generate their identity, and to prove ownership of other social profiles using social proofs and linked hashes. You will end the workshop with the ability to say to someone, hey- send a pile of btc to myname.id\r\nWe will utilize blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but no prior technical knowledge is necessary. \r\n\r\nWe will touch on distributed file systems such as Keybase which use this identity model to coordinate content addressable namespaces to facilitate content rich communication networks that include customizable permissions for social interactions with extended privacy, security and portability across multiple platforms. .\r\n\r\nReclaim your data, as the entry point into Web3.0 Interaction Design, Incentive Management for Crowd Sourcing and P2P business models, and Blockchain applications where the user controls their data, which stands apart from the application layer. Coordination of complex networks requires a user-centric data and identity model and the addition of cryptoeconomics and other cryptographic primitives, such as homomorphic encryption and zero knowledge proofs, and other trustless coordination and consensus mechanisms introduce new superpowers for building increased user agency online. \r\nThe workshop will focus on generic use-cases, and high-level abstractions of the self sovereign identity concept, and then we will dive into specific use cases that utilize specific products and protocols. The focus will be on conveying a general understanding of how powerful this concept will be in future web technologies, and within the context of current cloud.\r\n\r\nThis workshop outline is a living draft and additional links and info is forthcoming.","datetime_start":"2018-06-07T21:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2018-06-07T22:30:00.000Z","tag_list":["self-sovereign-identity","keybase","uport","civic","stellar","web3.0","blockchain","decentralized-web","knowledge-sharing","cybernetics-bitcoin","ethereum"],"location_name":"Room 15"},{"year":2018,"id":155,"title":"Kundalini Yoga Brain Break","description":"This practice is perfect for starting and finishing your projects.\r\n\r\nKundalini Yoga is a technology that harnesses the power of human consciousness, awareness and potential.

Unfortunately I have a limited budget and resources and might be unable to provide coffee tasting for everyone (I'll try my best!) so do bring your own bag of drip coffee (and cups if you're saliva conscious) if you would like to share your beans with the class!","datetime_start":"2018-06-16T16:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2018-06-16T18:00:00.000Z","tag_list":["coffee","101","basics","tasting","drip","espresso"],"location_name":"Room 15"},{"year":2018,"id":173,"title":"The MP3 Experiment Outing","description":"My favorite thing that happens every summer in New York (aside from Shakespeare in the Park) is the MP3 Experiment put on by Improv Everywhere.

There is over $400 million dollars currently set aside to fund innovative projects that prove the viability of decentralized web technologies.

Most of the old military installations are abandoned, and military structures which formerly housed artillery (batteries) and ammunition (magazines) are covered in graffiti. A few buildings have been renovated and are used by local arts groups, and some large open areas are used as sports grounds. Atop one of the old batteries, Battery Harris East, a viewing platform has 360-degree views, which include the city, New York Harbor, and the Atlantic Ocean.

You have to observe and perceive the scene first, before you even think of capturing it. Therefore learning how to \"see\" is paramount, because you can't account for an element in your frame that you are not aware of. _\"You are responsible for every part of your image\"_, and when you are composing the scene, you are excluding more than you include. Learning about composition comes afterwards. \r\n\r\nIn this class we will learn about foundations of the art side of photography. An image is still a rectangular 2D medium, so for the most part it follows the same composition rules as in graphic design or painting. After that we will learn about elements in craft side of photography that turns this particular 2D format into a unique medium with a unique language. \r\n\r\n_\"All things in nature are dark except where exposed by the light\"_, so in the second half of this class, i will teach you solid foundations of light and color, how it relates to the subject, and how it relates to the camera. \r\n\r\nThroughout the class we will learn how to analyze and learn about lighting and composition from the works of masters in photography, cinema, painting, and even comics.

Yes!","description":"Electric Etching is the process of using electricity and an electrolyte to etch a pattern onto a metal surface. A non-conductive pattern is placed over the material to be etched. The metal to be worked on is then grounded. The live wire is then connected to the applicator. When the applicator is applied to metal surface, wherever is not masked will be etched. The advantage of using electricity to etch metal is that it is a very predictable process. If it is desirable to have a deep etch, a higher current or longer exposure time increases the prominence of the edge. While this all can sound complicated, it can be done with just a 9-volt battery, a q-tip, alligator clips and some salty water!\r\n\r\nDuring this session we will hand-cut stencils from vinyl (you can upgrade your project by using a vinyl cutter available on the floor ahead of time for making a stencil), and practice electric etching on a scrap piece of metal I provide.  Another upgrade you can do is to bring your own metal object from home! (Any conductive metal is great including copper, aluminum, stainless steel, brass, etc)\r\n\r\nIf we have a lot of sign ups, people will be sharing equipment, so if you happen to have a 9-volt battery and alligator clips of your own, it would be helpful if you bring it.","datetime_start":"2019-06-05T15:00:00.000Z","datetime_end":"2019-06-05T16:00:00.000Z","tag_list":["diy","simple","metalwork","handson"],"location_name":"Room 20"},{"year":2019,"id":188,"title":"Intro to making music with Ableton Live","description":"I did this class last summer... people seemed to enjoy it, so here's another one for anyone who wasn't there (or wants a refresher)!\r\n\r\nAfter a brief intro into what makes Ableton unique among Digital Audio Workstations, we'll dive right into making some music.

This session is a survey of the various new directions AI is heading towards in the coming years and the creative applications these new developments may enable. Sub-topics will include:\r\n\r\n - **Language models get serious**: for 4 years, we've laughed as char-rnn stumbled around and said amusing things. Now, language models are writing paragraphs with human-rivaling coherence. What are the implications of this on media, journalism, and public discourse?\r\n\r\n - **AI on a dime**: cheap low-power microcontrollers are starting to replicate the kind of deep learning functionality that 5 years ago required expensive large workstations. Where are the most interesting places we can put these new devices?\r\n\r\n - **iPod of the future**: Since WaveNet in 2016, generative models of audio have been gradually evolving from just text-to-speech to music and natural sound. This will affect not just the production of music, but the consumption of it too. How and for whom will top-10 hits in the future be made, and how will they be listened to?\r\n\r\n - **Private decentralized machine learning**: What happens when we can do machine learning at scale without putting all the data in one computer?
